# Gif Tastic

## Description
Gif Tastic is a basic web application that allows user to hit the Giffy API and will return ten random gifs to the page. Users can add to their favorites, which stores the information to local storage and allows users to access them in the favorites modal. 

## Languages and Frameworks Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* LocalStorage

## Instructions
When the application loads, there are prepopulated buttons on the left. Clicking a button will bring up ten still gifs that are tagged with that subject. If you want to add a subject of your own, type it into the box and press enter or submit and a new button will populate. To get the images to play or stop, simply click on the image. If you want to add it to your favorites tab, click add to favorites. These will persist across sessions as they are stored in local storage. To view favorites, click the favorites tab and the modal will appear. If you want to remove a Gif from favorites, click the remove button. 

## Support
If you come across any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the code or the UI, please feel free to comment! I would love to improve the code, especially the interfacing with the API, and I want to improve my UIs as a whole. 

## Project Status
This project is part of a web development program I am currently enrolled in and is in the works. I will continue to improve upon it over the next few months. Directions at the moment include: 
* Better responsiveness for mobile
* More standardized card sizes
* Ceneterd menu bar (Maybe start breaking away from bootstrap and working with flexbox)
